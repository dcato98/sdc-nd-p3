# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

## Project #3: Behavioral Cloning

The goals of this project are to:
* Use a simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolutional neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images (model.py)
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set (model.h5)
* Test that the model successfully drives around track without leaving the road (drive.py)
* Summarize the results with a written report (writeup.md)
